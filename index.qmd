Navigate the Roadmap Gradually: Prepare, Build and Then Scale

In response to emerging drivers for change, organizations gradually navigate their priorities on the road to the future of applications:

•	The early priority on this path is to **prepare** for transformative changes by adjusting and engaging in new forms of activity and technology (the more advanced organizations may be well into, or already past, this stage in 2020).

•	Once prepared, organizations are ready for the next priority, namely to **build** new solutions and organizational practices (this is the challenge awaiting most organizations in 2020).

•	Once successful with early transformative changes, an organization needs to **scale** its innovation, investment and business in order the maximize the benefits of digital business transformation.

Lower Priority (Scale)

•	Enable pervasive self-service assembly of application experiences: From dedicated specialists trained to assemble business capabilities for role-centric application experiences, the initiative must migrate eventually to the users of the applications. Well-implemented, democratized, augmented tools and well-designed PBCs will help make self-service pervasive. You will also need to evolve your approach to sourcing packaged capabilities to reflect new consumption and delivery models from vendors.

•	Harvest global vendor marketplaces for extended business value: Well-functioning assembly, integration and secure governance operations enable organizations to broaden their business innovation opportunities by looking beyond familiar sources of business capabilities to global PBC markets and ecosystems populated by smaller and more specialized vendors.

•	Prune and optimize business and technology operations to preserve agility: To retain the openness and agility required for fast, safe and effective continuous innovation, organizations must continuously work to prevent (or reduce) the growth of technical debt. To do so, they must learn not just how to create great new solutions, but also how to replace or remove solutions that have lost most or all of their business utility.

•	Increase talent versatility and promote mobility: Success of the transition to the future of applications will depend on the organization having continued access to required and inspired competencies. The fast pace of innovation puts significant pressure on people in an organization because they are required to learn and change at a faster pace. To take new applications and business models from isolated success to pervasive presence, an organization must retain, train and inspire all its people. The development of joint business-IT product teams is a proven way to develop versatility in an organization and to promote a culture of collaboration.
